1) Go to script.google.com and create a new script.
2) Next, click "Services" and add the advanced drive services Drive API and label it "Drive".
3) Paste the code into the editor and save.
4) Run the privateInfo() function once.
5) Enter the required info under Settings->Script Properties.
6) Run the main function specifying how many months back you want to go.
